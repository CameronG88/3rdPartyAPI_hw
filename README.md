# 3rdPartyAPI_hw

This project was to create a web page that allows the user to plan out their daily work schedule using an 8am-6pm hourly schedule layout. That layout is then to be dynamically styled to be different colors based on whether that hour is in the past, future or the present time.

Also all users inputs will be saved to local storage and can be edited as well

## How it works

The application is fairly easy to use. To create a note or an event to your schdeul simply click the colored text area next to the hour you wish to set this even for, type your note then click the save button to the right of the text area. To edit an existing note just click on the note text and begin to edit then press the save button (this is also how you would delete a note).


## Criteria needed

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
